# #TheCocktailApp

Demo URL - [https://sranka23.github.io/cocktail](https://sranka23.github.io/cocktail)

The demo app created from the [cocktail db](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php). The purpose of this demo is to 
- demo API consumption
- demo the use of design system
- implement component reusability
- implement some tests to demonstrate the use of jest with react-testing-library.

## Key Pointers

- React v17
- Jest with react-testing-library
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Material UI for basic re-usable components
- Responsive layout
- Browser Support : All latest browsers (not supported on IE11)

## Code Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/cocktail](http://localhost:3000/cocktail) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


## Roadmap
### UX and UI
- The APIs will be used to create dynamic filterable UI which needs exporing multiple APIs with architecture.
- The page strucutre as of now are a little independent and nature and next step is to build right breadcrumbs and navigation to connect them meaningfully. 
### Testing
- Add end to end automation test cases using Testcafe (preferable) or wdio.
